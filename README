Exploring different data stores.

This is a personal continuation of Portland State University CS-510 Data Management in the Cloud.

The group project was to to implement a graph in a given data store and the following functions:

1) Friends of friends
2) Transitive Closure
3) Bridges

Bridges can be done by brute force with transitive closure or by Tarjan's method. The two do not produce the same results.

See https://github.com/bdombrow/CS-510_Cassandra for my groups Cassandra implementations.
